# 52446-Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis---Assignment-2018
Semester 2. This is a 5 Credit Module. This assignment is worth 60% of the overall grade for this module.

Ian’s instruction for this assignment;

Minimum standard:
A git repository containing a README, a gitignore file & a Jupyter notebook. 

When I created the repository in github I ensured I added a README & a gitignore.

The README need only contain an explanation of what is contained in the repository and how to run the Jupyter notebook.

My notebook should contain the main body of work and list all references.

Good submission requirements;
•	Clearly organised
•	Contain concise explanations of the particularities of the dataset.
•	The analysis contained within the notebook will be well conceived, interesting, and well researched.
•	Part of the assignment is about the use of Jupyter notebooks – I should make use of all the functionality available in the software including images, links, code & plots.

I knew I needed to bear these conditions in mind while completing this assignment to ensure I met the requirements.

After reading the assignment requirements I knew I would need to look back at my github repositories from last semester in which I submitted assignments for previous modules to refresh my memory on how to use github correctly.  

This assignment concerns the well-known Anscombe’s quartet dataset. I am required to create a Jupyter notebook analysing the dataset. 

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in my Jupyter notebook;
1.	Explain the background to the dataset – who created it, when it was created, and any speculation I can find regarding how it might have been created.
2.	Plot the interesting aspects of the dataset.
3.	Calculate the descriptive statistics of the variables in the dataset.
4.	Explain why the dataset is interesting, referring to the plots and statistics above.
