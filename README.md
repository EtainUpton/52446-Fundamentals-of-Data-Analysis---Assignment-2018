# 52446-Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis---Assignment-2018
Semester 2. This is a 5 Credit Module. This assignment is worth 60% of the overall grade for this module.

Ian’s instruction for this assignment;

Minimum standard:
A git repository containing a README, a gitignore file & a Jupyter notebook. 

When I created the repository in github I ensured I added a README & a gitignore.

The README need only contain an explanation of what is contained in the repository and how to run the Jupyter notebook.

My notebook should contain the main body of work and list all references.

Good submission requirements;
•	Clearly organised
•	Contain concise explanations of the particularities of the dataset.
•	The analysis contained within the notebook will be well conceived, interesting, and well researched.
•	Part of the assignment is about the use of Jupyter notebooks – I should make use of all the functionality available in the software including images, links, code & plots.

I knew I needed to bear these conditions in mind while completing this assignment to ensure I met the requirements.

After reading the assignment requirements I knew I would need to look back at my github repositories from last semester in which I submitted assignments for previous modules to refresh my memory on how to use github correctly.  

This assignment concerns the well-known Anscombe’s quartet dataset. I am required to create a Jupyter notebook analysing the dataset. 

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in my Jupyter notebook;
1.	Explain the background to the dataset – who created it, when it was created, and any speculation I can find regarding how it might have been created.
2.	Plot the interesting aspects of the dataset.
3.	Calculate the descriptive statistics of the variables in the dataset.
4.	Explain why the dataset is interesting, referring to the plots and statistics above. 

When reviewing my previous submissions from 7 months ago to my github repository for last semester’s module 52167 - Programming and Scripting I was able to quickly refresh my memory and recall some of the basic but important skills I had learned in terms of submitting content to a README in github, such as how to upload an image;
While researching READMEs I wondered how I would correctly upload an image (e.g. a chart) to GitHub. I learned this from Mastering Markdown and have included some images in this README. I will delve into the initial challenges I faced while trying to successfully complete this; I knew how to upload pictures to a README in GitHub from Mastering Markdown. The below image is supplied on Mastering Markdown and I employed this technique to initially upload images from the web to README;
 
However, I was unsure how to correctly upload screenshots from my own machine to show the work I had completed in Visual Studio Code. I remembered covering this in the ‘READMEs’ video on Moodle, so I referred back to this for guidance. I learned that you must follow the same formula as shown in the above image in terms of the exclamation point at the beginning of where you wish to insert an image, square brackets containing a description of what the image represents, and regular brackets with the name of the image from the web, however you insert the name of the image which you have saved in your GitHub repository from your own machine inside the regular brackets brackets. I initially tried to complete this with a PNG file, but when this did not work I saved the image on my desktop again as a JPG file and was able to upload it to the repository and successfully upload it to the README. I also realised through trial and error that there can be no spaces in the name of the image.
I also learned that it is possible to hyperlink Python.

Name of Module: 52167 - Programming and Scripting
Subject of the assignment:
Research on the subject of Fisher’s Iris data set
Completed 7 months ago

I also realised that if I clicked on the README in my repository and then clicked ‘Edit this file’ I’d see exactly what I had done to create headings in bold, etc for this README;
 

I remembered that it was as simple as including a # before the sentence I wanted to make a title/heading;
